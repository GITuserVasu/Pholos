Candidate Datasets:

Synthetic spike data generated by a network of 1,000 Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons
(figshare.com). This will be used while developing the algorithm for testing and fine
tuning. Has data for 1000 neurons and about 19,000 firings for each.

Dynamical response properties of neocortical neurons to conductance-driven
time-varying inputs (figshare.com). This will be used to test the algorithm with real data
from rats for varying frequencies. This has data for 336 neuronal spike trains.

Neuronal data of vibrissal somatosensory cortex in a texture-discrimination task
(figshare.com). This will be used to test the algorithm to see if the information content
from the algorithm matches the actual information (texture discrimination). (Data is from
rats again). We have not looked at the content of this data set deeply. It is set up as
Matlab datasets.

Temporal Features of Spike Trains in the Moth Antennal Lobe Revealed by a
Comparative Time-Frequency Analysis (figshare.com). This will be used to test for both
frequency based (inter spike interval changes) and actual information for moth data. We
have not looked at the content of this data set deeply. It is set up as Matlab datasets.
